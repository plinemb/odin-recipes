    <h2> Finished Recipe </h2>
    <p>This chicken Parmesan pasta bake is perfect for potluck meals, family gatherings, or in a smaller batch as comfort food for the family. It's my take on traditional chicken Parmesan. I came up with this for my wife's corporate potluck lunch. She wanted chicken Parmesan but it was too difficult to feed 20 people the conventional way. I figured a casserole would work just as well. It did!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package uncooked rotini pasta</li>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 cups flour</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
