    <h2> Finished Recipe </h2>
    <p>This chicken Parmesan pasta bake is perfect for potluck meals, family gatherings, or in a smaller batch as comfort food for the family. It's my take on traditional chicken Parmesan. I came up with this for my wife's corporate potluck lunch. She wanted chicken Parmesan but it was too difficult to feed 20 people the conventional way. I figured a casserole would work just as well. It did!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package uncooked rotini pasta</li>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 cups flour</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ (32 ounce) jars marinara sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup dry red wine (such as Sangiovese)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until pasta has cooked through but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Make a breading station: Place flour, egg, and bread crumbs in three separate bowls. Mix garlic powder into bread crumbs. Working in batches, coat chicken in flour, then dip in egg, and finally coat with bread crumbs.</li>
        <li>Carefully fry coated chicken in hot oil in small batches until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, 3 to 4 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drain fried chicken over paper towels.</li>
        <li>Combine cooked pasta, fried chicken, 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese, and 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese in a large bowl. Stir in marinara sauce. Pour red wine into the empty marinara sauce jar; cover and shake the jar, and empty the contents into the bowl of pasta. Stir to combine. Spread pasta mixture in a large casserole dish and cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove the aluminum foil and sprinkle with remaining mozzarella cheese and 1/2 cup of Parmesan. Return to the oven and continue baking until cheese has melted, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving. Serve hot.</li>
